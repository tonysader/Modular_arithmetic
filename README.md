# Modular_arithmetic
1- Find prime numbers: choose start and end then click show.
2- Solve Extended euclidean: extended GCD:
    Set A & B and it will show you a table with full results and details of the euclid, and show the GCD of the numbers, Greatest Common Divisor.
    Extended Euclidean algorithm also refers to a very similar algorithm for computing the polynomial greatest common divisor and the coefficients of Bézout's identity of two univariate polynomials. The extended Euclidean algorithm is particularly useful when a and b are coprime.
    The extended Euclidean algorithm. 
3- Solve the Euler Phi Function, euler's phi, for positive integers, ϕ(n),Euler's totient function:
    Just set n and it will give you the results with the reason
    In number theory, Euler's totient function counts the positive integers up to a given integer n that are relatively prime to n.
    ϕ(n) is the number of non-negative integers less than n that are relatively prime to n.
4- Solve modular linear equations:
  Set some numbers to solve modular linear equations. 
  Get results of modular linear equations.
